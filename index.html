							I'm currently a PM on <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=what+to+watch" target="_blank">What to Watch</a>, a recommendation platform for shows and movies.  I'm launching the product in 70+ locales and am investigating how to improve growth and retention in high-priority regions.
						</p>
						<p>
							I've also been leading metrics for the product, developing &amp; driving a new metrics strategy. I've introduced new methodologies like cohort analysis and have been formulating CUJ and lightweight proxy metrics that can be tracked longitudinally and used to guide our efforts to improve retention.

							<strong class="bolder">Pixel 4a:</strong>
							As the software PM for the Pixel 4a, I was responsible for the holistic software experience and collaborated  with... well, everyone.  I was involved in everything from the product marketing narrative, to software deadlines, to keeping regional teams in the loop, to crafting PR comms and customer support responses.
							<br><br>
							I represented the device <strong>internally and externally</strong> &mdash; briefing 40 journalists from top publications (WIRED, Forbes, The Guardian), presenting at Pixel-wide All-Hands, and presenting weekly updates to Pixel VPs and other senior leaders.  
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong class="bolder">Pixel Essential Apps:</strong>
							I defined a product vision for the Bedtime experience in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.deskclock&hl=en_US" target="_blank">
							Google Clock app</a>, driving the project from concept to a successful <a class="callout-link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/digital-wellbeing/improve-your-sleep/" target="_blank">launch</a> (Bedtime now sees X mil DAU).  It was a complex effort that required forging relationships with multiple internal teams and external partners (e.g. Calm, Spotify), developing and displaying results from an ML model that can detect time spent in bed, and crafting a pixel-perfect UI for our millions of users.

							Our mission at Archer was to make public data accessible. We created <a target="_blank" class="callout-link" href="https://archerimpact.com">Archer Public</a>, a platform to visualize how companies and people are connected across borders, datasets, and documents &mdash; and make these insights verifiable and actionable to everyday citizens.
						</p>
						<p> 
							My role was spanned full-stack engineering, design, product strategy, and more.  I built the data API and parts of the React frontend, as well as architected the underlying knowledge graph.  Additionally, I worked on all of the design, including the platform's branding and UI/UX.
						</p>
						<p>
							I also created mocks as part of a contract with <a href="https://www.eyewitness.global/" target="_blank">eyeWitness</a>. The mocks were for a database for storing and verifying evidence of war crimes to submit to the UN, International Criminal Court, and domestic courts. I <a href="https://twitter.com/eyewitnessorg/status/1025357030670983168" target="_blank">sat down with</a> their analysts and lawyers to understand their workflow and design an interface that best suited their needs.

							I built <a target="_blank" href="https://sanctionsexplorer.org">SanctionsExplorer</a>, the most modern (and most loved by the community!) publicly-available platform for searching and understanding U.S. Treasury sanctions. (Note: C4ADS has since acquired the project; it used to look like <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vVhblI6rOTA3Eyab_XMNegAAt2ATYwn1/view?usp=sharing" class="callout-link" target="_blank">this</a>.)
						</p>
						<p>
							I conducted user interviews, designed the platform's interface, and built the frontend and backend (Python, NodeJS, ElasticSearch) [<a href="https://github.com/archerimpact/SanctionsExplorer" target="_blank">GitHub</a>].  I worked with two other Berkeley students on the cloud deployment and XML data parser.
						</p>
						<p>
							We <a class="callout-link" href="https://medium.com/archerimpact/sanctionsexplorer-democratizing-access-to-ofac-sanctions-data-d448bad5ce37" target="_blank">launched</a> in April 2018 to an overwhelming amount of positive feedback from the international community, including multiple government agencies (including a certain Bureau...), journalists &amp; media organizations, academic researchers, NGOs, and private banks &amp; companies around the world.  The Treasury <a href="assets/img/Treasury_Challenge_Coin.JPG" class="callout-link" target="_blank">recognized our work</a>, and now I'm the proud owner of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge_coin" target="_blank" >Challenge coin</a>!
