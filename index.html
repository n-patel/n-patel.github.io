					<p class="experience-date">Aug 2019 - 2020</p>
				</header>
				<p>
					<strong class="bolder">Pixel 4a:</strong>
					As the software PM for the Pixel 4a, I was responsible for the holistic software experience of the device and liaised between... well, everyone (software, hardware, product marketing, PR, GTM, customer support, and more).
					<br><br>
					I represented the device <strong>internally and externally</strong> &mdash; pre-briefing dozens of tech journalists across EMEA, presenting at Pixel-wide All-Hands, and communicating weekly updates to senior leadership.  The role naturally gave me so many insights into releasing a physical device, as I was involved in everything from the product marketing narrative to crafting PR &amp; customer support responses.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong class="bolder">Pixel Essential Apps:</strong>
					I defined a product vision for the Bedtime experience in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.deskclock&hl=en_US" target="_blank">
					Android Clock app</a>, driving the project from concept to a successful <a class="callout-link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/digital-wellbeing/improve-your-sleep/" target="_blank">launch</a> (Bedtime now sees XXmil users each day).  It was a complex effort spanning multiple internal teams and a couple of external partnerships (e.g. Calm, Spotify).

					<p class="experience-date">May - Sept 2018</p>
				</header>
				<p>
					Archer was a startup focusing on making public data accessible. We created Archer Public, a platform to visualize how companies and people are connected across borders, datasets, and documents &mdash; and make these insights verifiable and actionable to everyday citizens.
				</p>
				<p> 
					 My role was spanned full-stack engineering, design, product strategy, and more.  I built the data API and parts of the React frontend, as well as architected the underlying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph" target="_blank">knowledge graph</a>.  Additionally, I worked on all of the design, including the platform's branding and UI/UX.

					<p class="experience-date">Aug 2017 - May 2018</p>
				</header>
				<p>
					I built <a target="_blank" href="https://sanctionsexplorer.org">SanctionsExplorer</a>, the most modern (and most loved by the community!) publicly-available platform for searching and understanding U.S. Treasury sanctions. (Note: the current site's UI has changed since I worked on it; it used to look like <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vVhblI6rOTA3Eyab_XMNegAAt2ATYwn1/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">this</a>.)
				</p>
				<p>
					I conducted user interviews, designed the platform's interface, and built the frontend and backend (all <a href="https://github.com/archerimpact/SanctionsExplorer" target="_blank">open-source</a>!).  I worked with two other Berkeley students on the cloud deployment and XML data parser.
				</p>
				<p>
					We <a class="callout-link" href="https://medium.com/archerimpact/sanctionsexplorer-democratizing-access-to-ofac-sanctions-data-d448bad5ce37" target="_blank">launched</a> in April 2018 to an overwhelming amount of positive feedback from the international community, including multiple federal agencies, journalists &amp; media organizations, academic researchers, NGOs, and private banks &amp; companies around the world.  The Treasury <a href="assets/img/Treasury_Challenge_Coin.JPG" class="callout-link" target="_blank">recognized our work</a>, and now I'm the proud owner of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge_coin" target="_blank" >Challenge coin</a> from the Treasury!

					<h4 class="experience-title">Software Engineering Intern @ <a target="_blank" href="https://tanium.com">Tanium</a></h4>
					<p class="experience-date">Jun - Aug 2017</p>
				</header>
				<p>
					As an intern, I developed a plug-and-play NodeJS module that could be integrated into many separate (but similar) products that Tanium offered. This module allowed developers to specify which metrics should be exposed to customers; these metrics would then be collected and could be displayed (which was more difficult than it sounds, given the arbitrarity of the data) to both technical and nontechnical customers.
